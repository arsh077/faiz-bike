export const TERMS_AND_CONDITIONS = `
1. DEFINITIONS
"Company" refers to Faiz Bike Point. "Customer" refers to the individual purchasing the vehicle. "Vehicle" refers to the pre-owned two-wheeler being transacted.

2. VEHICLE CONDITION & WARRANTY
All vehicles are sold on an "as-is, where-is" basis unless otherwise explicitly stated in writing. While we ensure all vehicles undergo a quality check, the Company does not provide a manufacturing warranty unless the vehicle is still under the original manufacturer's warranty period. The Customer is advised to inspect the vehicle thoroughly before purchase.

3. PAYMENT TERMS
Full payment must be cleared before the delivery of the vehicle. We accept cash, bank transfers (IMPS/NEFT/RTGS), and UPI. Cheques are subject to realization. A booking amount is non-refundable if the Customer cancels the order after 24 hours.

4. TRANSFER OF OWNERSHIP (RTO)
The Customer is responsible for providing valid ID proof and address proof for the transfer of ownership. The Company will assist in the documentation process, but the RTO processing time is subject to government norms and delays. The vehicle remains the legal liability of the previous owner until the transfer is officially recorded in the RTO records, though possession is transferred to the Customer.

5. INSURANCE
The specific vehicle price may or may not include third-party insurance. Comprehensive insurance is the responsibility of the Customer.

6. RETURN POLICY
Once the vehicle is delivered and the sale deed is signed, no returns or refunds will be entertained.

7. JURISDICTION
Any disputes arising out of this transaction are subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts in Kolkata.
